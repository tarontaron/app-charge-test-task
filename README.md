AppCharge Test Task
Introduction
Welcome, a React application built using Vito as the foundation. This readme provides an overview of the project structure, the technologies used, and key components that contribute to the application's architecture.

Technologies Used
Vito: The app is created using Vito, a powerful tool for scaffolding React applications, making development faster and more organized.

React: The core of the application is built on React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Styled Components: We have adopted styled components for styling, providing a seamless integration of styles with components.

Project Structure
The project follows a modular and organized structure to enhance maintainability and scalability.

src/components: This directory houses all the components used in the application. Each component is designed to be reusable, facilitating a modular and efficient development process.

src/constants: Constants, such as configuration parameters or data, are stored in this folder. This ensures easy access to and management of consistent values throughout the application.

src/utils: The utils directory contains utility functions, including data-fetching functions and custom hooks. This separation allows for a clean and organized approach to managing utility functions.
